and never leave the device.

## Storage and encryption

Data that you input are stored in browsers' local storage. If a browser, for
some reason (like disabled JavaScript), does not offer the local storage API
this app will not initialize and will not work.

When you enter data about your coins and transactions, before they get safely
stored in your browser, they will get encrypted using the AES-256 algorithm.

Therefore, it is necessary to remember your password for the portfolio, in order
to be able to load and decrypt them the next time you load the page.
